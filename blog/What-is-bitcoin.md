## 1. What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is an all-in cryptocurrency created based on blockchain technology.
It is a compound word of bit and coin, which are the basic units of information on a computer, and the monetary unit of Bitcoin is indicated by BTC.
The process of making Bitcoin is described as "catching" compared to the mining industry, and the person who makes Bitcoin is called a "miner."
You can solve math problems with computer programs and mine Bitcoin directly or purchase it in a market that deals with mined Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is traded completely anonymously and the total amount of money issued is set at 21 million due to strict restrictions on the amount of money supplied, and if the distribution exceeds a certain standard, the amount of mining that can be done at once decreases and problems become difficult, increasing scarcity.

### 1-1. Mining of Bitcoin

Bitcoin's mining is a process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger, called blockchain, with the aim of checking the accuracy of all transactions and allowing all participants on the network to view the ledger.
For mining, conditions must be met as a physical space where a miner can be placed, stable supplied power, and a miner.

Blocks are created by solving mathematical operations created by Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, where miners get a certain level of bitcoin in return.
However, participating in mining does not mean that anyone can receive Bitcoin, and only the miner who created the block receives compensation.

2-1. Reason for Bitcoin's half-life?
2-2. What's the aftermath of a half-life?

## 3. What is a half-life of Bitcoin?

This means that the reward given to Bitcoin miners is halved, and the new supply of Bitcoin is halved.
Bitcoin, which has limited overall issuance, is halved in mining compensation every four years, and Bitcoin is designed to halve mining compensation when a certain quantity is distributed.

### 2-1. Reasons for Bitcoin's half-life

The total amount of Bitcoin issued is 21 million, designed to be completed by 2140.
Designed to face 32 antipathy, about 19 million bitcoins are currently mined and the remaining bitcoins are about 2 million.

### 2-2. What's the aftermath of a half-life?

On November 28, 2012, the first half-life, there were 25 rewards per block, and the price was $12 per block,
Second, on July 9, 2016, the reward was 12.5 pieces, the price was $650,
Third, on May 11, 2020, the reward is 6.25 pieces and the price is 8,000 dollars.
You can see a significant price increase every half-life that returns every four years.
