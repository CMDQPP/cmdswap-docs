When someone makes a token swap, a transaction fee of 0.1% will be charged. 0.05% will be returned to liquidity providers in the form of a fee reward. The liquidity pool will also allow you to stake your LP tokens to earn CMDS tokens in the “Farms”. Hence, apart from earning income from token swap transactions, a user will be able to stake LP tokens and earn CMDS tokens.
