Cmdswap Exchange is an automated market maker (AMM) that allows a user to exchange two tokens on the Arbitrum network. The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers ("LPs") who stake their tokens in Liquidity Pools. In exchange, a user gets LP tokens that can also be staked to earn CMDS tokens in the "Farms".
When a user makes a token swap (trade) on the exchange, a trading fee of 0.1% will be charged, which is broken down in the following way:
0.05% is returned to liquidity providers in the form of a fee reward
0.05% is used for CMDS token burning

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Cmdswap may increase the trading fee in the future. A portion of this increase will be allocated to the team. Even after the increase of the trading fee, it is not going to be higher than the industry's average!
